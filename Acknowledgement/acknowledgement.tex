And I would like to acknowledge ...

First and foremost,  my academic supervisor, Prof. Panagiotis Louridas
for supporting me during this semester by pointing me to the right
direction in choosing an interesting, both academically and practically,
topic for this thesis, as well as for his immediate support whenever I 
needed it. As well as Prof. Diomidis Spinellis for teaching me what a good
research paper looks like.

I would also like to show gratitude to all my colleagues in GRNET,
who treated me first as a friend, and taught me all I know when it comes to
recruiting and selecting employees. Moreover, I would like to point out Ntora Morfi
and George Korfiatis from GRNET and thank them for trusting me and bringing me onboard
to their organization.

Finally, I would like to thank my family and friends.
Without their patience, encouragement and support all these four years of my studies,
this paper would have never been accomplished.
