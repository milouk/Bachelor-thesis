At a strategy level, the Tallinn Declaration, marked on sixth October 2017
[cite 2], affirms the duty to the vision spread out in the EU eGovernment
Action Plan 2016-2020 [cite 3] and in the European Interoperability Framework (EIF)
[cite 4]. In the following five years (2018-2022), steps will be taken towards
the proclaimed standards in EU open organizations, specifically: "computerized
naturally, comprehensiveness furthermore, availability", "once-just", "dependability
and security", "transparency and straightforwardness", and "interoperability as a
matter of course", just as national interoperability structures dependent on the
European Interoperability Framework (EIF).

In the Declaration the “user-centricity principles for design and delivery of
digital public services” is vital. Public administrations and digital public services,
upon interaction must have: digital interaction, accessibility, security, availability
and usability, reduction of the administrative burden, digital delivery of public services,
citizen engagement, incentives for digital service use, protection of personal data and
privacy, redress and complaint mechanisms. While not explicitly covered inside the extent
of this study, computer based intelligence can possibly improve public services and contribute
to the objectives set out in the Tallinn Declaration. For instance, the Commission will look
into AI's potential to analyze big amounts of data and help check how single market
rules are applied [cite 5].

Moreover, the digital transformation of society, business and government is raising
issues for a range of policy matters across the EU. As e-government has
been in place for the last 20 years, it is timely to explore the interplay between
technology and government activities from the perspective of digital government.
To comprehend the intertwined forces that play a role in this transformation process,
and their dynamics, contributions from disparate fields and discourses on this topic
should be contrasted and compared.

At the same time, the Communication on “Building the data economy” (COM (2017) [cite 9])
looks at proven or potential blockages to the free movement of data and presents
options to remove unjustified and or disproportionate data location restrictions
in the EU. It also considers the barriers around access to, and transfer of,
non-personal machine-generated data and data liability, as well as issues related
to the portability of non-personal data, interoperability and standards.
In particular, it calls for the fostering of technical solution development for
the reliable identification and exchange of data. 

A further avenue for research, complementary to this context of the digital
transformation of government, is the use of Web Application Programming Interfaces
(hereafter called “APIs”)). APIs can be seen as “safe entry ports for new and
innovative uses of data” held by companies and potentially, public administrations.

An opportunity exists to understand the current context and uptake of this technology
early in the innovation cycle of e-government in Europe.

In this context,we are going to conduct a study to provide an analysis of the
Web APIs as enablers for the digital transformation of governments. While
digital transformation of government is much wider than the technologies which
can potentially support it, an analysis of the role of APIs in the public sector
is highly relevant to illustrate how technology can enable transformation of
government. This study explores APIs, and their role in the EU public sector as
well as it enumerates the differences with the private sector and analyzes future
trends.

\section{API Overview} %Section - 1.2


APIs have become a foundational technological component of modern digital
architectures, impacting every sector of the global economy. In the public
sector specifically, APIs are a key enabler of the accelerated evolution
of government and its agencies from analogue (manual, paper) operations,
to digital. 

The purpose of our study is to create a report that will support member
states with the adoption of APIs when in pursuit of their digital
transformation. In order to explore this purpose, our investigation has
incorporated (but is not limited to) the following topics:

\begin{itemize}
	\item The current use of APIs in the EU public sector.
	\item Differences between API use in the public sector and the private sector.
	\item The future trends for APIs.
	\item The relationship with location data.
	\item Insights from eight case study interviews, using real world examples
	to explore different dimensions of the API landscape, including API Strategy,
	API Ecosystems, and specific APIs.
\end{itemize}

Our approach is covered in detail in the Methodology section later in this report.
In summary, we have used a combination of desk based research and interviews to
gather information for analysis. For the interviews, we used a questionnaire to
collect information from representatives of a set of successful but diverse API
based case studies from a range of EU countries and sectors.

\textbf{API Overview}

API interaction occurs when one application would like to:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Access or query the data held by another application.
	\item Send data to that application
	\item Update data held in that application
	\item Request a service from another application
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Types of APIs}
Crucially, the use of APIs therefore simplifies, and standardises the interface
reducing complexity and cost of deployment over that of custom built interfaces.
APIs represent an architectural approach that revolves around providing
programmable interfaces to different applications. It is technology agnostic,
and creates a flexible, loosely coupled architecture that allows a solution to be
made up of components that can more easily be switched in and out. The API approach
is also a key enabler for application developers to build apps that rapidly adapt
to end user needs [cite 6]. 

In the public sector, APIs enable important functionality and information held in
one agency’s system or department to be readily available to another without
significant and expensive development effort. As well as cross-departmental
(agency) access to functionality and information (or even cross-border with a
different country’s administration) APIs also provide the ability to share
information and functionality more widely, i.e. to developers and ultimately
to citizens for consumption through web or mobile based applications.

Although there are many different types of API (see Appendix I), this study is
most concerned with Web APIs. Web services expose these APIs as endpoints that
any internet-enabled language or software can access, in exactly the same way
browsers access websites and services [cite 7]. Web APIs deliver requests to the
service provider, and then deliver the response back to the requestor,
i.e. they are an interface for web applications, or applications that need to
connect to each other via the Internet to communicate [cite 8].

Web APIs themselves can be broken down further based on the type of data format
that they harness, for example, well known types are Simple Object Access Protocol
(SOAP), Remote Procedure Call (RPC) based APIs, and the Representational State
Transfer (REST) architectural style. GraphQL – is a data query language growing
in popularity and has been adopted by leading social media outlets such as Facebook
and Pinterest [cite 9] as a type of API. While typical REST APIs require loading
from multiple URLs, GraphQL APIs get all the data an app developer needs in a single
request enhancing speed of response even on slow mobile network connections [cite 10].

Whilst the more traditional APIs are used as integration points within systems
hidden from view, Web APIs are often publicly available and can be ‘advertised’
via API Directory sites online. Tens of thousands [cite 11] are available for developers
to deliver consumable information to end users to do everything, from checking
traffic and weather, to updating a social media status, or even to make payments.

In the geospatial domain, besides existing private companies famous API proposals
(e.g. Google Map), the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) has created standards to
support the exchange of geospatial information [cite 12]. They describe their Web services
API standards as an agreed specification of rules and guidelines about how to
implement software interfaces and data encodings [cite 13]. Geospatial software vendors,
developers and users collaborate in the OGC’s consensus process to develop and
agree on standards that enable information systems to exchange geospatial
information and instructions for geoprocessing. OGC standards are open standards.
The OGC interface standards are also available in the REST style, and cover a
number of aspects:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Visualisation standards e.g. Web Map Service (WMS).
	\item Data Access Standards e.g. Web Feature Service (WFS), SensorThings API.
	\item Processing Standards e.g. Web Processing Service (WPS).
	\item Metadata and Catalogue Service Standards e.g. Catalog Service for the Web (CWS).
	\item The informatics contract between the client code which manipulates normalized
	data structures of geographic information based on the published API and the library
	code, e.g. the GeoAPI Implementation Standard.
\end{itemize}

The standards above are part of the few globally agreed specifications adopted by
the Technical Committee 211 of the International Organization for Standardization
(ISO). ISO is also known to be working on standards in other sectors, notably in
Financial Services with ISO 20022 [cite 14]: however, because of they are work in
progress,
details about them are still limited. Whilst standards of this formal and specific
nature are used in the EU, there is clear evidence that the need for harmonising
APIs lifecycle has been recognised. For example, the UK Government Digital Service
recognised that departments were developing APIs using different tools, platforms
and approaches [cite 15], and have set about working with industry to create a set of
common principles for API design. The output has been a set of guidelines on how
developers working in any UK public sector organisation should build APIs [cite 16] to
ensure consistency, and success. Although they are titled as a ‘standard’, they
are generic, and not exact or specific in the way that an ISO or OGC standard is.
Nevertheless, given the fact that government is increasingly using APIs to
automate processes and provide citizens with access to new services it is hoped
this approach will make integration simpler and faster.
