In this section, we will identify current thinking on how the use of APIs may evolve over the next 3 to 5
years.
• Growth Rate - There is some evidence that the growth of APIs has slowed to some degree63.
However, although the number of APIs may not be growing at the rate that was predicted a few
years ago, their use and the ecosystems that they support continue to thrive.
• Digital Government Platform growth requires APIs - Predictions on the future trends in Digital
Government from research companies such Forrester and Gartner indicate that Digital Government
Platforms (interoperable, horizontal microservices that are orchestrated by RPA (Robotic Process
Automation) software will become more prevalent in the 3-5 year window64. Digital Government
Platforms require APIs as the integration mechanism to move data between component systems
and therefore governments will continue to invest in switching from a service-oriented architecture
(SOA) to a modular architecture (MASA) utilising APIs and micro-services.
• Government will invest in Intelligent Things requiring APIs – It is likely that governments will
continue to increase investments in intelligent things, across many domains — from defence,
policing, waste management, health, agriculture and smart communities65 to enhance service
delivery quality, and efficiency. Sensor and video networks, intelligent drones, fleets of automated
vehicles, and robotic devices will become core to government service delivery capability and serve
as a real-time data source for government, using APIs to transfer data among IT systems and
layers.
It is anticipated that the next progression will see the environment composed of many physical
things with both sensor and computation capabilities, which make the technology direction
pervasive and invisible66.
Applications will be capable of communication, cooperation, and negotiation with each other. Unlike
general applications, agents will be designed with goals to be fulfilled on behalf of its users. That is,
agents will take necessary actions efficiently towards its environment over the P2P protocol. For
example, an agent can be designed to read a patient’s biometrics from a patients wearable sensor
devices and adjust thermostats to heat or cool a patient’s room appropriately. In this way, the new
platform is not limited to a certain set of devices, and it opens many possibilities over the P2P
protocol to produce novel (multi-Agent) applications that enrich the idea of ubiquitous computing67.
• APIs as products – APIs are products, and as such should have a product lifecycle from
conception and improvement through to retirement. Government IT departments will continue to
move away from APIs just being a technology to implement and forget. Given growing ecosystems
dependent on APIs, communicating to third-parties, monitoring usage, and removing at an
acceptable time (i.e. versioning) will be important.
• API Standards – The cost savings that can be realised by not having to redesign an API due to its
‘drag and drop’ portability seem compelling. The ability for applications and data sources to be able
to link without the need for a bespoke API takes us one step closer to the ubiquitous platform of
unbounded data. However, for many, knowing the specification of an API, and then getting to know
the specific nuances of the API via the developer portal of an API provider seems to be a
necessary, and perhaps keeps the developer community in work.
• Citizen developers and Open APIs - Open APIs make it very easy for citizens to make use of
open data, or improve existing applications which leverage it. Hackathons will become more
widespread as a way for the public sector to engage with citizens, helping member states to meet
the aims that they have of conducting significant user research prior to releasing any citizen facing
services or data68 changes could potentially come faster than if we were to wait for the vendor to
implement them. This process is very similar to open-source software, which is widely used and
very helpful for developers.

\section{Conclusion}

The future of digital government seems deeply linked to the use of the APIs as enablers. As the
technological demands of digital government move forward, it appears that APIs are well positioned to keep
pace, and provide the access points needed to enable fast and secure data sharing to support
government’s needs from law and order, to healthcare and the environment. As with all aspects of
technology, the use and development of APIs will evolve over time.
